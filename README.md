# Armada-spark

**Run Apache Spark workloads on [Armada](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada), a multi-cluster Kubernetes batch scheduler.**

**armada-spark** is an open-source integration designed to streamline deployment and management of Apache Spark workloads on Armada.
It provides preconfigured Docker images, tooling for efficient image management, and example workflows to simplify local and production deployments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java** 11 or 17
- **Apache Maven** 3.9.6+
- *(Optional)* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for local clusters
- An accessible Armada server and Lookout endpoint — see the [Armada Operator Quickstart](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator) to set one up
- Before running build or test scripts, you must define the target Spark and Scala versions. These are used to select the correct build profiles and dependencies. You can configure these by creating a scripts/config.sh file (refer to scripts/config.sh.example) or by exporting them in your environment:
```
export SPARK_VERSION="3.5.5"
export SCALA_VERSION="2.13.8"
```
You can either set these environment variables individually or pass the versions directly into your command. For example:
```bash
mvn -Pscala2.13.8,spark3.5.5 clean package
```
### Build

The default build targets **Spark 3.5.5** and **Scala 2.13.8**:

```bash
mvn -Pscala2.13.8,spark3.5.5 clean package
```

To target a different Spark/Scala version, enable the matching Scala and Spark profiles:

```bash
mvn -Pscala2.12.15,spark3.3.4 clean package
```

This replaces the old `./scripts/set-version.sh` workflow.

### Supported Version Matrix


| Spark | Scala   | Java |
| ----- | ------- | ---- |
| 3.5.5 | 2.12.18 | 17   |
| 3.5.5 | 2.13.8  | 17   |


### Planned Future Version Support


| Spark | Scala   | Java |
| ----- | ------- | ---- |
| 3.3.4 | 2.12.15 | 11   |
| 3.3.4 | 2.13.8  | 11   |


### Build Docker Images

```bash
./scripts/createImage.sh [-i image-name] [-m armada-master-url] [-q armada-queue] [-l armada-lookout-url]
```


| Flag | Description        | Example                    |
| ---- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `-i` | Docker image name  | `spark:armada`             |
| `-m` | Armada master URL  | `armada://localhost:30002` |
| `-q` | Armada queue       | `default`                  |
| `-l` | Armada Lookout URL | `http://localhost:30000`   |
| `-p` | Include Python     |                            |
| `-h` | Display help       |                            |


By default the image is built for the host architecture only and loaded into
the local docker daemon. Set `PUSH=true` to build a multi-arch image
(`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) and push it as a manifest list to the registry
named by `IMAGE_NAME`:

```bash
PUSH=true ./scripts/createImage.sh
```

This lets a single image name serve mixed environments, for example building
on an Apple Silicon Mac (native arm64, no emulation) while amd64 cluster nodes
pull the amd64 variant of the same tag.

You can store defaults in `scripts/config.sh`:

```bash
export IMAGE_NAME="spark:armada"
export ARMADA_MASTER="armada://localhost:30002"
export ARMADA_QUEUE="default"
export ARMADA_LOOKOUT_URL="http://localhost:30000"
export INCLUDE_PYTHON=true
export USE_KIND=true
```

For **client mode**, set additional values:

```bash
export SPARK_DRIVER_HOST="172.18.0.1"                    # Required for client mode
export SPARK_DRIVER_PORT="7078"                          # Required for client mode
```

### Deploy to a Local Cluster

We recommend [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for local testing. If you are using the [Armada Operator Quickstart](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator), it is already based on kind.

```bash
kind load docker-image $IMAGE_NAME --name armada
```

### Running a remote Armada server using Armada Operator

The default Armada Operator setup allows only localhost access.  You can quickly set up a local Armada server
configured to allow external access from other hosts, useful for client development and testing. For this
configuration:

- Copy the file `e2e/kind-config-external-access.yaml` in this repository to `hack/kind-config.yaml`
in your `armada-operator` repository.
- Edit the newly-copied `hack/kind-config.yaml` as noted in the beginning comments of that file.
- Run the armada-operator setup commands (usually `make kind-all`) to create and start your Armada instance.
- Copy the `$HOME/.kube/config` and `$HOME/.armadactl.yaml` (that Armada Operator will generate) from the Armada
server host to your `$HOME` directory on the client (local) host. Then edit the local `.kube/config` and on
the line that has `server: https://0.0.0.0:6443`, change the `0.0.0.0` address to the IP address or hostname
of the remote Armada server system.
- Generate a copy of the client TLS key, cert, and CA-cert files: (1) go into the `e2e` subdirectory, and
run `./extract-kind-cert.sh` - it will generate `client.crt`, `client.key`, and `ca.crt`, from the output
of `kubectl config view`. These files can be left in this directory.
- Copy the `$HOME/.armadactl.yaml` from the Armada server host to your home directory on your client system.
- You should then be able to run `kubectl get pods -A` and see a list of the running pods on the remote
Armada server, as well as running `armadactl get queues`.
- Verify the functionality of your setup by editing `scripts/config.sh` and changing the following line:

```
ARMADA_MASTER=armada://192.168.12.135:30002
```

to the IP address or hostname of your Armada server. You should not need to change the port number.

Also, set the location of the three TLS certificate files by adding/setting:

```
export CLIENT_CERT_FILE=e2e/client.crt
export CLIENT_KEY_FILE=e2e/client.key
export CLUSTER_CA_FILE=e2e/ca.crt
```

- You should be able to now verify the armada-spark configuration by running the E2E tests:

```
$ ./scripts/dev-e2e.sh
```

This will save its output to `e2e-test.log` for further debugging.

## Running Example Workloads

### SparkPi

```bash
# Cluster mode + dynamic allocation
./scripts/submitArmadaSpark.sh -M cluster -A dynamic 100

# Cluster mode + static allocation
./scripts/submitArmadaSpark.sh -M cluster -A static 100

# Client mode + dynamic allocation
./scripts/submitArmadaSpark.sh -M client -A dynamic 100

# Client mode + static allocation
./scripts/submitArmadaSpark.sh -M client -A static 100
```

Run `./scripts/submitArmadaSpark.sh -h` for all available options. The script reads `ARMADA_MASTER`, `ARMADA_QUEUE`, and `ARMADA_LOOKOUT_URL` from `scripts/config.sh`.

### Jupyter Notebook

The Docker image includes Jupyter support (requires `INCLUDE_PYTHON=true`):

```bash
./scripts/runJupyter.sh
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8888`. Override the port with `JUPYTER_PORT` in `scripts/config.sh`. Example notebooks from `example/jupyter/notebooks` are mounted at `/home/spark/workspace/notebooks`.

#### Spark Connect

Pass `-C` to run in Spark Connect mode (experimental). The Spark Connect server runs in the cluster (Armada cluster mode) and Jupyter connects to it as a thin gRPC client:

```bash
./scripts/runJupyter.sh -C
```

Spark Connect requires a Python-enabled image, so set `INCLUDE_PYTHON=true` in `scripts/config.sh` before building (or pass `-p` to `createImage.sh`).

**First run: the Spark Connect jar must be baked into the image.** The jar is optional in the image build, so the very first time you use `-C` you need to download it and rebuild, in this exact order:

1. `./scripts/runJupyter.sh -C` - downloads the Spark Connect jar into `extraJars/`, then stops and asks you to rebuild.
2. `./scripts/createImage.sh` - rebuilds the image with the jar baked into `/opt/spark/jars`.
3. `./scripts/runJupyter.sh -C` - run again; the server now starts.

The jar lives at `local:///opt/spark/jars/...`, which is on the driver's classpath only once it's baked into the image, so the rebuild is required.

Use `kubectl port-forward` command for the connect port (`15002`). Allocation follows `-A static|dynamic` (default dynamic); in static mode set `EXECUTOR_INSTANCES` to choose the executor count. 

See `[spark_connect_demo.ipynb](example/jupyter/notebooks/spark_connect_demo.ipynb)`.

### Spark History Server

View event logs from completed jobs:

```bash
./scripts/runHistoryServer.sh
```

Requires S3 credentials and `spark.eventLog.enabled=true`. UI at `http://localhost:18080`.

### File Distribution (`--files`)

See `scripts/filesParameterExample.sh` for a working example of distributing local files to driver and executor pods using Spark's `--files` parameter and `SparkFiles.get()`.

### Benchmarks (TPC-DS)

```bash
./scripts/benchmark.sh           # Run against Armada
./scripts/benchmark.sh -K        # Run against native Kubernetes
```
